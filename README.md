# Oculus Quest Android NDK Example

This is basically the `VrSampleBase` example taken from the [OVR Mobile
SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-mobile-sdk/) (version
17.0, API 1.34.0), but as a single application that can be used as a starting
point for custom applications. It uses CMake for building C++ modules.

## Getting started
- Install Android Studio, open this project with `Open Existing Project`
- Download the [Oculus OVR Mobile
  SDK](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-mobile-sdk/) and
  set the environment variable `OVR_HOME` to the location where the SDK has been
  extracted.
- Build the application in Android Studio
